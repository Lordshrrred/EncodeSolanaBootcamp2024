# EncodeSolanaBootcamp2024
This is to document my progress through the Encode Solana Bootcamp towards my goal of becoming a competent and capable Rust Developer within the Solana Ecosystem.

Completed homeworks will be found in Homework_Completed directory and will in Markdown format. 

If you desire to reference the actual homework assignments they are located in Homework_Assignments directory.

Lessons are located in the Lessons directory.

I put a serious amount of effort into this bootcamp to transform myself. My heart is in Solana, I love it and desire to work within this ecosystem. Though my coding development experience is minimal I implore you to seriously consider me for a role within your organization. I put my heart into everythig I do. I make up for lack of experience with my very own special sauce and insatiable work ethic.

Thank you for taking a look at progress within this bootcamp and for considering me for your team.

Matt :)
