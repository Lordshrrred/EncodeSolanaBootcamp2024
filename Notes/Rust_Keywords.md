In addition to let, there are several other common keywords in Rust that you should be familiar with as a Rust developer. These keywords play important roles in defining the structure and behavior of Rust code. Here are some of the most commonly used ones:

fn: Used to declare a function.
```
fn my_function() {
    // Function body
}
```

mut: Used to declare a mutable variable.
```
let mut x = 5; // Mutable variable x
```
const: Used to declare a constant variable. Constants must have a type annotation.
```
const MAX_POINTS: u32 = 1000; // Constant variable MAX_POINTS
```
match: Used for pattern matching, similar to a switch statement in other languages.
```
match number {
    1 => println!("One"),
    2 => println!("Two"),
    _ => println!("Other"),
}
```
if / else: Used for conditional branching.


```
if condition {
    // Code to execute if condition is true
} else {
    // Code to execute if condition is false
}
```
loop: Used to create an infinite loop or loop with a break condition.
```
loop {
    // Infinite loop
}
```

while: Used to create a loop with a conditional exit.
```
while condition {
    // Code to execute while condition is true
}
```
for: Used for iteration over collections or ranges.
```
for item in collection {
    // Code to execute for each item in the collection
}
```
return: Used to return a value from a function.


```
fn add(a: i32, b: i32) -> i32 {
    return a + b;
}
```
unsafe: Used to declare unsafe code blocks where Rust's safety guarantees are temporarily bypassed.
```
unsafe {
    // Unsafe code block
}
```
use: Used to import items from other modules.
```
use crate::module::Item;
```
mod: Used to declare a module.

```
mod my_module {
    // Module contents
}
```
crate: Used to refer to the root of the current crate.
```
crate::my_function(); // Call a function from the current crate
```
These are some of the most commonly used keywords in Rust, but Rust has many more keywords and constructs that you'll encounter as you gain more experience with the language.
