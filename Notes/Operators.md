let’s go through the operators in Rust and explain each one:

#### Arithmetic Operators:

+: Adds two numbers together.

-: Subtracts the second number from the first.

*: Multiplies two numbers.

/: Divides the first number by the second.

%: Finds the remainder of the division of the first number by the second.

#### Comparison Operators:

==: Checks if two values are equal.

!=: Checks if two values are not equal.

>: Checks if the value on the left is greater than the one on the right.

<: Checks if the value on the left is less than the one on the right.

>=: Checks if the value on the left is greater than or equal to the one on the right.

<=: Checks if the value on the left is less than or equal to the one on the right.

#### Logical Operators:

&&: Returns true if both operands are true, otherwise returns false.

||: Returns true if at least one of the operands is true.

!: Returns true if the operand is false and vice versa.


#### Bitwise Operators:

&: Performs a bitwise AND operation.

|: Performs a bitwise OR operation.

^: Performs a bitwise XOR operation.


<<: Shifts the bits of the first operand to the left by the number specified by the second operand.

>>: Shifts the bits of the first operand to the right by the number specified by the second operand.

!: Performs a bitwise NOT operation (it’s usually ~ in other languages).



#### Compound Assignment Operators:


+=: Adds the right operand to the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

-=: Subtracts the right operand from the left operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

*=: Multiplies the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

/=: Divides the left operand by the right operand and assigns the result to the left operand.

%=: Applies the modulus operation and assigns the result to the left operand.

&=: Applies bitwise AND and assigns the result to the left operand.

|=: Applies bitwise OR and assigns the result to the left operand.

^=: Applies bitwise XOR and assigns the result to the left operand.

<<=: Applies left shift and assigns the result to the left operand.

>>=: Applies right shift and assigns the result to the left operand.


#### Other Operators:


=: Assigns the value of the right operand to the left operand.

.: Accesses a member of a struct or an enum.

->: Used in function signatures to indicate the return type.

..: Creates an exclusive range when used in range expressions.

..=: Creates an inclusive range when used in range expressions.

?: Used for error propagation; if the value is an Err, it returns from the function.

@: Used in pattern matching to bind a variable to a pattern.

=>: Separates patterns from code blocks in match arms.

,: Separates items in a list, such as function arguments or array elements.

;: Terminates statements or separates items in a tuple.

::: Separates modules, types, or associated functions.

#: Used for attributes or compiler directives.

!: Used to call macros.


These operators allow you to perform various operations on data, control the flow of your program, and work with different data structures in Rust. For a more comprehensive list and details on operator overloading, you can refer to the Rust documentation
