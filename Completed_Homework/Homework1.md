Decentralized Systems

**1. Tell about your goals for this course?**

Answer: My goals are to learn as much as possible so that I can break into the world of development on Solana. I’m aware I have a steep learning curve ahead of me but I believe in myself and will work very hard to become competent. In addition to this course I’m self studying through the multitude of resources available on Rust and Solana Development. I’m also going through Harvard’s CS50x to maximize my understandings and be best fit for the Solana development environment. My main goal is to a be competent Rust Developer within the Solana Ecosystem and find myself a career in the space. I currently work at Apple and I am there due to following my passion for technology. The next move in my career I intend to be driven by my passion for decentralization, the world of crypto and Solana itself. Solana is my favorite, I feel it’s the best out there, in my opinion It is the Apple of crypto. It simplifies the user experience in a much needed way such as the way Apple simplifies the computing experience for many end users. 


**2. Do you feel that Central Bank Digital Currencies (CBDCs) are a move towards decentralization? Will they help or hinder adoption of other cryptocurrencies?**


Answer: Yes and no. They are a move towards decentralization due to the fact they are in existence makes decentralization so much more important in this world. A CBDC is a centralized form of controlling money which absolutely what we do not need. However with all governments over arching reach it is inevitable and with that rise the role of decentralized cryptocurrencies becomes that much more important to protect the individual from our governments. Fundamental human rights such as freedom and privacy are at risk with CBDCs and there for decentralized forms of currency are vital to protecting the human being.
